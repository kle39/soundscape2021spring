The Dance Teacher Life, the life I love, the life I would not trade for anything! 
I am a dance teacher at South Hills Dance Academy!
As you listen to my audio, I will explain what a "typical" (used quite loosely) evening as a dance teacher consists of.
I will also draw attention to the COVID-19 safety measures we take at the dance studio to keep everyone safe. 
Throughout the audio, you will be able to hear me "in action" as I teach my students (the best students) genres of ballet, jazz, and tap, including one of my students' voice (with her mom's permission)!
Lastly, I convey the most upsetting point of the night - saying goodbye to my students! I really do not know what I would do without them. 
I hope you enjoy listening to my Soundscape Project and catch a glimpse into my life and something I love.
